# Project Pixel Canvas

## What is it?

A simple drawing(?) tool. You can click on places in the drawable area and it will draw a square there. You can choose the color and size of the canvas, as well as the color of your "brush."

This project was originally inspired by a challenge on The Odin Project.

## Why did I make it?

As an exercise in TypeScript, JavaScript and CSS Grid.

## Tech used

This project is built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The JavaScript was written almost entirely in TypeScript.

## Things I'd like to do:

- ~~Allow clicking and dragging to paint~~ Done!
- Implement 'default' button
- Implement eraser mode
- Add dark mode
- Export to image or vector
